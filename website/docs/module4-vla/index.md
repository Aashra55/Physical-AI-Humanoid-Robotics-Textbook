# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4, "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)". This module explores the cutting edge of physical AI, where robots integrate perception, language understanding, and physical action to perform complex tasks and interact naturally with humans. We will delve into how robots can bridge the gap between high-level human commands and low-level robot control.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, you will gain a deep understanding of:
- The concept of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and their significance.
- The principles and techniques behind multi-modal perception.
- How Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for robotic task planning.
- Integrating speech-to-text models like Whisper for voice control.
- The fundamentals of building conversational interfaces for robots.
- How to synthesize all acquired knowledge into a comprehensive capstone project design.
