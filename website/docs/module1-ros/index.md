# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)". This module provides a foundational understanding of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, which serves as the backbone for inter-component communication in modern robotics. Just as a nervous system coordinates bodily functions, ROS 2 orchestrates the various software and hardware components of a robot.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, you will gain a deep understanding of:
- The core concepts and architecture of ROS 2.
- How nodes communicate using topics, services, and actions.
- Best practices for organizing and building ROS 2 packages.
- The importance of URDF for robot modeling.
- Techniques for interfacing with different types of sensors.

## Chapters in this Module

1.  **[Introduction to ROS 2](intro_ros2.md)**: Explore the ROS 2 ecosystem and its significance in Physical AI.
2.  **[ROS 2 Nodes and Topics](nodes_topics.md)**: Understand the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 communication.
3.  **[ROS 2 Services and Actions](services_actions.md)**: Learn about synchronous and asynchronous request-response patterns.
4.  **[Building and Launching ROS 2 Packages](packages_launch.md)**: Discover how to structure, build, and orchestrate your robot software.
5.  **[Modeling a Humanoid with URDF](urdf_modeling.md)**: Grasp the essentials of creating a digital twin of your robot.
6.  **[Interfacing with Sensors](sensor_interface.md)**: Connect your robot to the physical world by integrating various sensor types.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:
- Comprehend the core principles of ROS 2.
- Develop basic ROS 2 applications using nodes, topics, services, and actions.
- Organize your robot code into ROS 2 packages.
