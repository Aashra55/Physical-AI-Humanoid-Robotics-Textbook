# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2, "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)". This module dives into the world of robotics simulation, a critical tool for developing, testing, and refining robot behaviors in safe, controlled, and cost-effective virtual environments. We will explore both Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for advanced visualization and human-robot interaction.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, you will gain a deep understanding of:
- The importance and benefits of robotics simulation.
- How to set up and configure robot models within Gazebo.
- The differences and interplay between URDF and SDF for robot and environment descriptions.
- Techniques for simulating various sensor types and integrating their data with ROS 2.
- Leveraging Unity for high-fidelity visualization, human-robot interaction, and creating interactive environments.
