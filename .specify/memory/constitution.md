# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity and Accessibility
All content must be written in clear, concise, and accessible language. Complex topics should be broken down into understandable components, with a preference for practical examples, diagrams, and simulations over dense academic prose. The primary goal is to lower the barrier to entry for learners.

### II. Technical Accuracy and Rigor
All technical information, including theories, formulas, code, and diagrams, must be fact-checked and peer-reviewed for accuracy. Claims must be supported by citations to reputable sources to build a trustworthy and reliable educational resource.

### III. Open-Source and Collaborative
The project is committed to open-source principles. All content and code must be licensed under a permissive license (e.g., CC-BY-SA for content, MIT for code). Contributions are encouraged and managed through a transparent, community-driven process on GitHub.

### IV. Practical Application and Hands-On Learning
The textbook must prioritize practical application. Theoretical concepts should be accompanied by code samples, tutorials, and simulated or real-world robotics projects. The chosen platform, Docusaurus, should be leveraged to create interactive examples and bridge the gap between theory and practice.

### V. Maintainable and Extensible Platform
The project will be built on Docusaurus and adhere to its best practices. The codebase and content structure must be kept clean, modular, and well-documented to facilitate long-term maintenance and future extensions.

## Technology and Tooling

The project will use Docusaurus as its primary framework for building the textbook website. All custom development, including React components and plugins, must adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution.

## Content Workflow

Content development will follow a structured workflow:
1.  **Proposal:** New topics or major revisions are proposed via GitHub Issues.
2.  **Drafting:** Content is drafted in Markdown.
3.  **Review:** Drafts are submitted as Pull Requests for peer review to ensure technical accuracy, clarity, and adherence to style guides.
4.  **Publication:** Once approved, content is merged and published.

## Governance

This Constitution is the supreme governing document for the project. All contributions, tools, and processes must comply with its principles. Amendments require a formal proposal, community discussion, and approval by project maintainers.
