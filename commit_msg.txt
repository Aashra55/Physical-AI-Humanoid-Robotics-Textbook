feat: Enhance indexing logging and adjust chunking for debugging

Modifies `chatbot_api/core/indexing.py` to add more detailed logging
during the document indexing process. This includes:
- Logging the total number of Markdown files found.
- For each file, logging its relative path, extracted text length, and
  the number of chunks generated.
- Introducing a `total_chunks_indexed` counter, reported at the end
  of the indexing process.
- Adding error handling for individual file processing to prevent
  indexing from stopping due to a single problematic file.

Additionally, the `chunk_text` function's `chunk_size` is temporarily
reduced to 200 and `overlap_size` to 50. This is a diagnostic change
to observe the impact on the number of generated chunks and help
determine if the chunking strategy is a contributing factor to the
lower-than-expected point count in Qdrant. This change will be reverted
once debugging is complete.
